      Anders, you rock!

    <p>
      Oh Anders! It's been a true honour to have you with us<br/>
      To Open Knowledge you have been a great plus.<br/>
      Here are a few of the things that we'll miss the most,<br/>
      Here's to Anders! An affectionate toast!
    </p>

    <p>
      He's smiling and gentle, a true "Cheshire cat"<br/>
      You can hear when he's coming as his shoes go - 'tap, tap'!<br/>
      Of Copenhagen descent - always riding his bike,<br/>
      A communist punk youth sporting Mohawk and spike
    </p>

    <p>
      He's so quick to work, always types in a flurry,<br/>
      He's got so much to do, no wonder he's in a hurry!<br/>
      We all have heard him typing loudly in calls<br/>
      Where we see less of him, more of ceilings and walls
    </p>

    <p>
      With a generous spirit and plenty of fun,<br/>
      Anders's smiles will bring out the sun<br/>
      An easy-going Dane, he works with pizzaz;<br/>
      His wife loves folk while he loves jazz? <small>(he might do, you never know)</small>
    </p>

    <p>
      His eternal happiness is somehow contagious<br/>
      And his willingness to help is somewhat outrageous!<br/>
      Don't be put off by his serious photo -<br/> 
      His grin is miles wide and his sense of humour loco!
    </p>

    <p>
      Unerringly professional, often suited and smart,<br/>
      He can look perfect for the Hill plus he's got a big heart<br/>
      Whether at the Bank or hanging with hackers,<br/>
      Heâ€™s a social chameleon, always hustling for backers.
    </p>

    <p>
      He types so quickly you can almost smell the smoke<br/>
      You may think he's a super hero but he's for real - it's no joke!<br/>
      He connects all the people who follow the money<br/>
      He always sweetens the deal with some sugar or honey.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the time is right he has incredible focus<br/>
      and of the OpenSpending world he's been the main locus<br/>
      Anders is dedicated, not one to shirk<br/>
      He's the hub of the follow the money network
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing Anders will make you feel oh so lucky<br/>
      Because once you come near he'll always be huggy<br/>
      A heavy workload can make things feel dim<br/>
      But we brighten the day, by working with him
    </p>

    <p>
      He has taken great care of the OpenSpending community,<br/>
      And we wish him the best of luck in this new opportunity<br/>
      His happy attitude kept us from going insane<br/>
      Wherever he goes he'll always be our Great Dane <small>(sorry Christian!)</small>
    </p>
